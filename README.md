# HTTP-Forward-Proxy-Spring-Boot
HTTP Url Froward Proxy Implementation using Spring Boot

An HTTP Forward Proxy is a type of server that sits between a client (like your web browser) and the internet. It acts as an intermediary that forwards your HTTP requests to the
destination server on your behalf.

How it Works:
Client → Proxy → Internet

You (the client) send a request to the proxy server.

The proxy server then sends that request to the actual destination server (like example.com).

When the destination server responds, the proxy sends the response back to you.

Why Use a Forward Proxy?
Anonymity: Hides your IP address from the destination server.

Access Control: Organizations can control which websites users can access.

Content Filtering: Block ads, adult content, etc.

Caching: Speeds up repeated requests by caching data.

Bypass Geo-Restrictions: Access content that might be blocked in your location.
